======
A genetically engineered solution to anyone's labor problems, a centaur is the obvious choice.

Centaur biology makes them fast and durable but may or may not be balanced by their larger size and inability to wear heavy armours. Probably way more OP when player controller with a sniper rifle than anyone could have guessed.

Mostly just a personal project, something is definitely broken in this version.
